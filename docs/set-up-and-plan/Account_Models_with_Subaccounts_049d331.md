# Account Models with Subaccounts

Account Models 1 - 5 show ways to structure your global account into subaccounts. Note that all of them are just examples. They are not mutually exclusive and you can adapt them to your own needs.

Once your global account is migrated to cloud management tools, feature set B, you will be able to make use of one more hierarchical level within your global account: While account models 1 - 5 are still possible, with feature set B, you can additionally use directories and custom properties to group subaccounts.
