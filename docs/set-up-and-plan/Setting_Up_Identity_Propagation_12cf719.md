# Setting Up Identity Propagation

SAP BTP provides various options for identity propagation.

The decision trees below for the SAP BTP Neo and Cloud Foundry environments might help you identify an appropriate setup; however, these are recommendations only. Your specific setup highly depends on your use case. In general, we recommend using the PrincipalPropagation authentication type with SAP systems and OAuth2SAMLBearer Assertion with third-party systems.
