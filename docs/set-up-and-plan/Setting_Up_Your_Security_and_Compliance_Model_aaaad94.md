-   **[Complying with Data Protection and Privacy Requirements](Complying_with_Data_Protection_and_Privacy_Requirements_84e144a.md)**  
All companies must respect data protection and privacy rights of individuals. Data protection and privacy most likely influences the architecture and functionalities of your application and should be considered as early as possible in the development process.

If you've set up a staged development environment using different subaccounts or spaces, such as for development, testing, and production, we recommend that you grant the Cloud Development Team access to development subaccounts and spaces, but that you grant only the Cloud Administration Team access to the testing and production subaccounts or spaces.
