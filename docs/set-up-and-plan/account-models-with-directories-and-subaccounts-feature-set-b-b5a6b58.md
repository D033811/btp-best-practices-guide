# Account Models With Directories and Subaccounts \[Feature Set B\]

With cloud management tools feature set B, we're introducing a more flexible account structure with directories.

## Directories

Apart from structuring your global account into several subaccounts, you can group individual subaccounts into directories to manage, operate, and analyze such groups of subaccounts together. One global account can contain up to five levels of directories, can contain n subaccounts each. All examples of using directories are based on [Using Subaccounts to Create a Staged Development Environment](using-subaccounts-to-create-a-staged-development-environment-74eb32e.md) and only use one level of directories.

Here are a few example use cases where directories help you manage your subaccounts:

-   Administrative reasons: Structure your global account according to the responsibilities within your organization. For example, give each subsidiary, department, or LOB their own directory.

-   Billing purposes: Structure your global account into directories for accounting purposes.

-   Geographical separation: Group subaccounts based on geographical locations to manage different local regulations or to improve network performance for groups that are located together.

-   Business scenario: Group subaccounts that belong to the same business scenario or according to other business needs. This gives you the option to control each business solution separately.

-   Resource limitations: Use the directory structure to control access to resources, limit usage by generating separate usage and cost reports, or define usage limitations, to give more resources to critical directories, or to enable different monitoring per directory. Or you could structure the subaccounts according to usage limits in different landscapes.

-   Technical reasons: Structure directories and subaccounts according to technical limitation and then add labels for virtual grouping or vice versa.

## Labels

Directories and subaccounts can be tagged with **labels** for easy organizing and filtering. Also, labels can be attached to other entities in your global account, such as environment instances and service instances. Think of labels as a way of virtually grouping subaccounts or directories that belong together or for which you want to create reportings.

Here are some examples of simple labels:

-   Landscape: Dev, Test, Prod

-   Department: HR, IT, Finance, Sales

-   Cost Center: 000001234, 000001235

-   Flagged for deletion

-   Important




> ### Tip:  
> Directories and labels offer two different ways of structuring subaccounts into groups. We recommend to use directories as the primary structuring mechanism and to use labels to build virtual groups of subaccounts or directories for which you need to create reports.
> 
> The below-mentioned account models for feature set B work for all environments. A subaccount with feature set B can either be a multi-environment subaccount where Cloud Foundry, Kyma, ABAP can be enabled, or it can be a Neo environment subaccount. For the account structure, there's no difference. Inside a subaccount, you can further structure your projects depending on the environment, for example by creating Cloud Foundry spaces.

## Account Model 6: Create Directories Per Functional Area

This account model is based on Account Model 5 for feature set A, but it has directories as additional structural elements, i.e. a separate directory for each functional area and one for central services that are used by all.

Within each of those directories, three subaccounts \(for development, test, and production\) are created. For each directory, the functional area can use their own identity provider and manage their entitlements. Additionally, you can make use of labels, for example for the person responsible, cost center, or other aspects that you need for reportings later on.

## Example of naming conventions for this account model in the Cloud Foundry environment

To ensure that there are no conflicts with special characters, we recommend to stick with lower-case letters and hyphens, and not to use spaces in names. This way, you can name a subaccount, its subdomain, and its Cloud Foundry org exactly the same. Cloud Foundry spaces should be named identically across the three tiers \(dev, test, prod\).

## Account Model 7: Create Directories Per Location

In this account model, you create different directories for geographical areas. Additionally, for example, you can add labels to subaccounts that belong to the same departments in those locations. Alternatively, you could nest additional directories inside these ones.

## Account Model 8: Create Directories Per Subsidiary

In this account model, you create directories for each subsidiary of your company. Additionally, you canadd labels, for example, for cost centers or owners of the individual subaccounts or directories.

## Checklist for the Account Model Setup

Independent of the account model you choose, we recommend to go through the following steps and define guidelines for your development teams.

-   To ensure that there are no conflicts with special characters, we recommend to stick with lower-case letters and hyphens, and not to use spaces in names.

-   Give the directory a descriptive name that starts with your company / global account name.

-   There is a 1:1 relationship between Cloud Foundry org and a subaccount, so you should give them identical names.

-   Since there is no connection between spaces in differet subaccounts, we recommend to give identical names to the dev, test, and prod versions of projects and spaces.
