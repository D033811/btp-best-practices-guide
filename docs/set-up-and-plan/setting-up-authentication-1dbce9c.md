# Setting Up Authentication

SAP BTP provides various options for implementing user authentication.

Use the decision tree below to determine how to set up authentication. Once you've implemented authentication, you can start implementing user authorization.

> ### Remember:  
> There are two types of users on SAP BTP: platform and business. Platform users are usually developers, administrators, or operators who deploy, administer, and troubleshoot applications and services. Business users are those who use the applications that are deployed to SAP BTP.

Users can be authenticated by the Identity Authentication service or by the SAP ID Service \(default\).

> ### Recommendation:  
> We recommend that you use the Identity Authentication service and also connect any corporate IdPs to it.

The Identity Authentication service can authenticate users stored in the IAS user store, your own corporate user store, or by forwarding to your own corporate identity provider.
