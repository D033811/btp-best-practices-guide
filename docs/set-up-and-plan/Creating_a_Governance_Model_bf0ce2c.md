# Creating a Governance Model

One of the first and most important steps of your journey to the cloud is to establish an appropriate organizational setup and corresponding governance model. A clear and well-thought-out organizational setup makes it easier for your employees to adopt agile processes.

We also recommend that before you begin your development project, you create an onboarding process and a knowledge transfer process.

For example:

-   Define team setups \(including IT support roles and responsibilities\)

-   Create an onboarding process for development projects

-   Create a knowledge transfer process for the involved teams

-   Define support processes, operations documentation, and involved tools

-   Define activities to ramp up resources and implement changes \(support processes, tools, documentation\)

-   Clarify help desk processes and incident and change management


-   **[Building Teams](Building_Teams_fdeddf2.md#loiofdeddf22a6964d86a199b9eb11c7075e)**  
We recommend that you set up two types of teams: **Cloud Development Teams**, who build and operate applications, and a central **Cloud Administration Team / Center of Excellence**, who is responsible for any account operations, the build infrastructure, for defining central governance and compliance guidelines, and for driving cloud adoption throughout your organization.
-   **[Creating an Onboarding Process for Development Projects](Creating_an_Onboarding_Process_for_Development_Projects_4bd29a8.md)**  
If you're planning on starting multiple development projects on SAP BTP, we recommend that you set up an onboarding process to ensure that new projects are tracked and documented properly, compliant with the security standards and guidelines you define.
-   **[Creating a Knowledge Transfer Process](Creating_a_Knowledge_Transfer_Process_630c14c.md)**  
Carefully plan for sufficient enablement of all stakeholders, and ensure that the knowledge gained throughout your application lifecycle is shared with others.
