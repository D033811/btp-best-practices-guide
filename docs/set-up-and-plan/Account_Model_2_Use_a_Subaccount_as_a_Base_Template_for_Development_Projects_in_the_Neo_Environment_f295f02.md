# Account Model 2: Use a Subaccount as a Base Template for Development Projects in the Neo Environment

In this scenario, the IT department creates one subaccount that serves as a base template. If new subaccounts for a development project are required, the IT department clones the base template, thereby copying its configuration settings to the new subaccounts.

The owners of the development projects are responsible for application lifecycle management. As shown below, all new subaccounts are cloned from the base template, regardless of whether a project requires three subaccounts for each development stage, or whether only one DEV subaccount is needed \(for example, for a proof of concept\).

This account setup is especially well suited for organizations that rely heavily on a DevOps methodology with independent development projects.

> ### Note:  
> This account setup might require a high level of maintenance and governance efforts. For instance, it is important that the responsible teams of each project landscape stay tightly aligned. Since each team has full access to their subaccounts, it is important to define and follow guidelines for all projects, such as security requirements, access guidelines, governance processes, and so on.
