# Develop and Build

SAP BTP offers various tools and programming languages for application development. You might also want to consider to integrate your application with other solutions.

We recommend that you use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model for your development project. For more information, see [Cloud Application Programming Model](Cloud_Application_Programming_Model_042061d.md).

## Defining Development Guidelines

To ensure consistency and foster collaboration between developers, we recommend that you define guidelines that include standards for programming principles, code styles, and naming conventions.

SAP provides the following official guidelines:
