# Develop and Build

SAP BTP offers various tools and programming languages for application development. You might also want to consider to integrate your application with other solutions.

We recommend that you use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model for your development projects. For more information, see [Cloud Application Programming Model](cloud-application-programming-model-042061d.md).

Depending on your use case and the skill set of your developers, you can choose the runtime environment of your choice:
