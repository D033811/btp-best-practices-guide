# Continuous Integration and Delivery \(CI/CD\)

Depending on your use case, you can choose between different offerings for continuous integration and delivery.

> ### Note:  
> For links to all SAP solutions for CI/CD, blog posts, presentations, and tutorials, have a look at our [Continuous Integration and Delivery by SAP](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/CICD_OVERVIEW/Cloud/en-US?task=discover_task) overview.

**Continuous integration \(CI\)** describes a software development process, in which various team members integrate their contributions frequently into a single main line. Before each integration, the changes are verified through builds and automated testing. Thereby, you can detect errors as quickly as possible and prevent integration problems before completing the development.

The following graphic shows the basic flow for continuous integration:

The **continuous delivery \(CD\)** concept expands on the one of continuous integration. It adds the aspect that any change that has successfully passed the tests is immediately ready to be deployed to production, both from a technical and a qualitative point of view.

For more information about the continuous integration and continuous delivery concepts, see [What Are Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?](https://help.sap.com/viewer/8cacec64ed854b2a88e9a0973e0f97a2/Cloud/en-US/5ba483a2c97b4ad5ab0148f4a6c5a9ee.html).
