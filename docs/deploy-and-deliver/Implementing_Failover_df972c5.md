3.  [Define How a Failover Is Detected](Define_How_a_Failover_Is_Detected_88b86db.md "Define in which cases the automatic failover from one data center to the other is
		triggered.")  
Define in which cases the automatic failover from one data center to the other is triggered.
4.  [Decide on the Failback](Decide_on_the_Failback_963f962.md "In the setup of your failover scenario, define whether a failback is needed and how
		it is performed.")
